Description: # strongDM SDK for Python
        
        This is the official [strongDM](https://www.strongdm.com/) SDK for the Python
        programming language.
        
        Learn more with our [ðŸ“šstrongDM API docs](https://www.strongdm.com/docs/api/) or
        [ðŸ““browse the SDK
        reference](https://strongdm.github.io/strongdm-sdk-python-docs/).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install strongdm
        ```
        
        strongDM uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We do not guarantee
        compatibility between major versions. Be sure to use version constraints to pin
        your dependency to the desired major version of the strongDM SDK.
        
        ## Authentication
        
        If you don't already have them you will need to generate a set of API keys,
        instructions are here: [API
        Credentials](https://www.strongdm.com/docs/admin-guide/api-credentials/)
        
        Add the keys as environment variables; the SDK will need to access these keys
        for every request.
        
        ```bash
        $ export SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR ACCESS KEY>
        $ export SDM_API_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR SECRET KEY>
        ```
        
        ## List Users
        
        The following code lists all registered users:
        
        ```python
        import os
        import strongdm
        
        def main():
            client = strongdm.Client(os.getenv("SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY"),
                                os.getenv("SDM_API_SECRET_KEY"))
        
            users = client.accounts.list('')
            for user in users:
                print(user)
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```
